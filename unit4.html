												<h3>Diversity Discussion Video</h3>
											</header>
											<p>For our final unit, we had to do journalism and film. This was one of the more frustrating and time consuming projects I have ever done. For our summative, we had to choose a topic and have a debate on it regarding our opinions. My group chose the Divide in America as our topic and we wanted to have different views on this rather than just people agreeing with each other making the debate rather one sided. So we created different characters each with their different opinions and views on how America should be run. We used a green screen so that when we finished the final product it would look like we were in a newsroom of some sort. The problem with this was that the green screen wasnâ€™t big enough for all of us to sit at at once. This meant that we had to rework some of our shots. In addition to not having a big enough green screen, since everyone was filming in the general area there was a lot of background noise. I removed as much as I could when editing but it's still not perfect. When we were filming the video, we followed rules such as giving enough head space, making sure the subject is focused and that the each shot we took followed what we had written into our storyboard. The editing was very time consuming, we had so many clips and so much audio to sort through. Also we had to edit in a background, add sound effects, text overlays, an intro, and some background music. In the future, I plan on using what I learned here for my future short films and for videos I will be creating on my YouTube channel.
